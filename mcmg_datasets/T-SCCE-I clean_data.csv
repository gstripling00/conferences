2024-03-29,4,"The UI for SCC is not very user friendly or intuitive and thus it was difficult to search for what links or buttons I needed to click. The training could help by providing video clips of how to locate the button or link in question, for example in one of the findings the link I needed to edit a firewall rule was well below the fold on the lightbox UI.",5,4,"I learn best by doing, so I would have preferred the entire education be primarily within a lab environment so that I reinforced what I was doing by actually executing tasks. Perhaps allow an option for learners so we can specify the degree to which we want our education/experience to be via lab interaction (100% for me).",null,4

2024-05-02,4,"1 complaint about a misleading question: in ""Quiz: SCC Enterprise Fundamentals"" there is a question like ""Your company develops a new cloud-based application. You want to ensure maximum security during development and after the app is live. Which of these Security Command Center Enterprise features would directly support this goal? (Pick two)""  <--- this question only had 1 correct answer (""Protects infrastructure as code to establish consistent security rules during development.""), so to 100% the quiz I had to ignore the hint to pick 2 anwsers as any other answer was flagged incorrect",5,5,null,null,3
